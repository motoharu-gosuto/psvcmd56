//I used documentation from this source to clarify lots of things about gc commands
//https://wiki.henkaku.xyz/vita/F00D_Commands

//There can be some usefull info about SceSblAuthMgr crypto here (not GC):
//https://wiki.henkaku.xyz/vita/SceKernelModulemgr#SELF_Loading

//Some minor things about SceSblGcAuthMgr can be found here:
//https://wiki.henkaku.xyz/vita/SceSblGcAuthMgr

//It turned out that Gc Auth is related to KIRK
//I have used information about original KIRK from here:
//https://github.com/uofw/upspd/wiki/KIRK

//more things about KIRK from Proxima
//http://wololo.net/talk/viewtopic.php?f=6&t=7224

//it turned out that these commands are documented in xyz wiki:
//https://wiki.henkaku.xyz/vita/F00D_Commands

//in particular - these commands are for gcauthmgr_sm.self
//for constant 0x1000B - that I have in the code there are commands listed below.
//what is even more interesting - size of buffers that I have reversed (sub_CAC924_command) - matches to the documentation
//size of 0x800 buffer in _039c73b1_context also matches documentation
